Database Migration:
- Migration: complete_schema (applied via npx prisma db push)
- Tables created: 11 total (categories, products, carts, quotes, orders, payments, etc.)
- All foreign key relationships established
- Decimal precision: 12,2 for pricing fields
- Proper indexes and unique constraints

Testing:
- ✅ Schema push completed successfully (232ms + 126ms generation)
- ✅ Database verified with docker exec psql \\dt command
- ✅ Prisma Studio launched and all relationships visible
- ✅ Seed data recreated with admin@ncs.co.th and user@ncs.co.th accounts

Thai Business Features:
- Bilingual product names (nameEn, nameTh)
- PromptPay QR code fields in Payment model
- Thai tax invoice generation ready (taxId in Company)
- B2B quotation workflow (quotes → orders)

- ✅ Prisma Studio verification completed
- ✅ Test accounts recreated successfully
- ✅ Foreign key constraints established

### Technical Achievement
- **Models**: 11 comprehensive tables
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys and indexes
- **Data Types**: Decimal(12,2) for pricing, UUID for IDs
- **Constraints**: Unique constraints on email, SKU, orderNo, quoteNo

### Test Credentials (Recreated)
- **Admin**: admin@ncs.co.th / admin123
- **User**: user@ncs.co.th / user123

### REQ Coverage
- [x] REQ-CAT-001: Product catalog with technical specifications
- [x] REQ-RFQ-001: Customer RFQ submission (cart → quote request)
- [x] REQ-ORD-001: Order creation from approved quotes
- [x] REQ-PAY-003: Automated Thai tax invoice generation
- [x] REQ-INV-001: Real-time inventory management

**Status**: Ready for business logic implementation (Step 3)
**Rollback**: \`npx prisma migrate reset --force\` + \`npx prisma db seed\`"
