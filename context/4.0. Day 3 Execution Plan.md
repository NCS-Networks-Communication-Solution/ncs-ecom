# NCS B2B E-Commerce Platform Recovery Guide

Your project recovery situation is comprehensive and manageable. Based on analysis of your development stack and current state, here's your complete roadmap to get back on track with your January 11, 2026 launch timeline.

## Current project assessment

**What's already secured in your repository**: Your previous work through Day 2 means your foundational architecture is committed to GitHub. This includes your governance framework from Day 0, Docker Compose configuration with PostgreSQL and Redis from Day 1 Part 1, API specifications and DTOs from Day 1 Part 2, and your Next.js frontend setup plus CI/CD pipeline from Day 2. The git status showing "clean working tree, up to date with origin/main" confirms all committed work is safely preserved.

**What needs local restoration**: Your development environment requires complete rebuilding. This includes installing dependencies, recreating environment files, starting Docker services, and completing the Prisma setup that blocked you initially. The key insight is that your **architecture and code are safe** - you only need to restore the local development environment.

**Critical blocker analysis**: The Prisma setup issue you encountered is likely related to Node.js v22.20.0 compatibility. Research shows Node.js v23 and newer versions cause Prisma initialization failures with the error `(0 , import_util10.isError) is not a function`. Your v22.20.0 should work, but version conflicts remain the most common Prisma blocker in e-commerce projects.

## Step-by-step recovery plan

### Phase 1: Environment foundation (15-30 minutes)

**Start Docker services first**:
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/Desktop/Project_Hiroshima/ncs-ecom

# Start Docker Desktop if not running
open -a Docker

# Verify Docker Compose configuration exists
ls -la docker-compose.yml

# Start your infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d
```

**Create essential environment files**:
```bash
# Create development environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit with your local development values
# Essential variables for your stack:
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/ncs_ecom?schema=public"
# REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
# NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-dev-secret-key"
```

**Install dependencies correctly**:
```bash
# Use npm ci for deterministic installs from package-lock.json
npm ci

# This ensures exact dependency versions match your previous setup
```

### Phase 2: Service verification (10-15 minutes)

**Verify infrastructure services**:
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# Test PostgreSQL connection
docker exec -it postgres_container psql -U postgres -d ncs_ecom -c "SELECT 1;"

# Test Redis connection  
docker exec -it redis_container redis-cli ping

# Check port availability
lsof -i :3000  # Next.js frontend
lsof -i :3001  # Backend API (if separate)
lsof -i :5432  # PostgreSQL
lsof -i :6379  # Redis
```

**Database connection verification**:
```bash
# Test database connectivity before Prisma setup
npx prisma validate

# Pull current database schema (should be empty for fresh setup)
npx prisma db pull --dry-run
```

### Phase 3: Prisma blocker resolution (20-45 minutes)

**Address the Node.js compatibility issue**:
```bash
# First, verify your Node.js version is compatible
node --version  # Should show v22.20.0

# If Prisma generate fails, try these solutions in order:
# 1. Clear Prisma generated files
rm -rf node_modules/.prisma
rm -rf node_modules/@prisma/client

# 2. Reinstall Prisma packages
npm install @prisma/client prisma --save

# 3. Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

**Alternative solution if Node.js issues persist**:
```bash
# Switch to Node.js v20 using nvm (install nvm if needed)
nvm install 20
nvm use 20

# Re-run Prisma setup
npm install
npx prisma generate
```

**Complete database setup**:
```bash
# Push schema to database (creates tables)
npx prisma db push

# Run seed data (if available)
npx prisma db seed

# Open Prisma Studio to verify database
npx prisma studio
```

### Phase 4: Frontend service restoration (10-15 minutes)

**Next.js development server setup**:
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Verify frontend loads at http://localhost:3000

# Run health checks
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

**Test full stack integration**:
```bash
# Verify API routes work
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test database connectivity through application
# (Check any existing API endpoints that query the database)
```

## Handling the original Prisma blocker

Based on your stack and common e-commerce Prisma issues, here's how to navigate past your original blocker:

**Root cause analysis**: The most likely cause was Node.js version incompatibility, missing environment variables, or Docker service startup timing. Your fresh Mac with v22.20.0 eliminates the first issue.

**Systematic resolution approach**:
1. **Environment first**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is correctly formatted with your Docker PostgreSQL connection
2. **Service dependencies**: Start PostgreSQL before running Prisma commands
3. **Clean generation**: Always run `npx prisma generate` after any schema changes
4. **Migration strategy**: Use `prisma db push` for development instead of `migrate dev` to avoid shadow database issues

**Prevention for future development**:
```bash
# Add these scripts to package.json for easier development
"scripts": {
  "db:reset": "npx prisma migrate reset --force",
  "db:seed": "npx prisma db seed", 
  "db:studio": "npx prisma studio",
  "dev:db": "docker-compose up -d && npm run dev"
}
```

## Next steps to continue project momentum

### Immediate priorities (Today - Day +1)

**Verify complete development environment**:
- All services running locally (Docker, Next.js, database)
- Prisma client generated and working
- Basic CRUD operations functional through your API
- CI/CD pipeline still functional (test with a small commit)

**Resume development workflow**:
- Create a simple test page to verify full stack works
- Implement one basic API endpoint with database interaction
- Push changes to verify Git workflow is restored

### Short-term objectives (Week 1 post-recovery)

**Backend completion**: Finish the Prisma setup that was previously blocked, implement your core e-commerce models (User, Product, Order, Company), and set up authentication with NextAuth.

**Frontend integration**: Connect your Next.js frontend to the backend APIs, implement basic product catalog display, and set up shopping cart functionality.

**Development automation**: Create setup scripts for future environment rebuilds, document any platform-specific configurations, and establish proper backup procedures for local development data.

### Timeline realignment with launch target

**Current position assessment**: You're approximately 3-4 days behind due to the system rebuild, but your January 11, 2026 launch target remains achievable. Your foundational work (Days 0-2) is preserved, which represents significant progress.

**Recovery efficiency**: With this systematic approach, you should be fully operational within 4-6 hours. The previous blocker resolution will likely take less time now with a fresh environment and the knowledge gained from the initial attempt.

**Momentum maintenance**: Focus on quick wins after recovery - implement one complete feature end-to-end to rebuild development confidence and verify your full stack works correctly.

The key to successful recovery is systematic verification at each step. Your architectural decisions and code are safe in Git - you're simply rebuilding the development environment. With Node.js v22.20.0 and a fresh system, the Prisma issues that blocked you previously should be resolved through proper service startup sequencing and environment configuration.

**Critical success factor**: Don't rush the verification steps. Taking time to confirm each component works properly will prevent compound issues and get you back to productive development faster than trying to shortcut the recovery process.
