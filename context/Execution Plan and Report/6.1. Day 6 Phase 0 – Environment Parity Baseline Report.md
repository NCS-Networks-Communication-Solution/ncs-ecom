# Phase 0 – Environment Parity Baseline Report

## Executive Summary

Phase 0 establishes the foundational environment configuration to ensure proper alignment between Docker Compose services, frontend/backend communication, and API accessibility. This phase successfully addresses the critical Docker network misconfigurations and port mismatches that were preventing the NCS B2B E-Commerce Platform from functioning in a containerized environment. The phase serves as the prerequisite baseline for all subsequent development phases.

## Phase 0 Objectives and Actions

## **Primary Objective**: Environment Parity Baseline

**Owner**: DevOps Lead  
**Priority**: Critical (Blocking for all subsequent phases)

## **Core Actions Completed**

## 1. Docker Compose Port Alignment

**Configuration Applied**: The backend service in `docker-compose.yml` now correctly exposes port 3000 to align with documented API hosting requirements:5.8.-Day-5.5-HIGH-PRIORITY-Docker-Network-Configuration-Issues.md

text

`backend:   build:    context: ./backend    target: dev  ports:    - "3000:3000"  # Exposes backend API on documented port  volumes:    - ./backend:/usr/src/app    - /usr/src/app/node_modules  environment:    - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ncsadmin:ncs2025secure@postgres:5432/ncsdb    - REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379  depends_on:    postgres:      condition: service_healthy    redis:      condition: service_healthy`

**Resolution Impact**: Eliminates the critical Docker network configuration issue where backend services were unreachable from external clients.5.8.-Day-5.5-HIGH-PRIORITY-Docker-Network-Configuration-Issues.md

## 2. Environment Variable Standardization

**Configuration Verified**: The shared `.env` file maintains consistent port configuration:

bash

`NODE_ENV=development PORT=3000 DB_PASSWORD=ncs2025secure DATABASE_URL=postgresql://ncsadmin:ncs2025secure@localhost:5432/ncsdb REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 JWT_SECRET=ncs-jwt-secret-dev-2025`

**Override Strategy**: Docker Compose overrides localhost references with appropriate service names while preserving local development compatibility.5.8.-Day-5.5-HIGH-PRIORITY-Docker-Network-Configuration-Issues.md

## 3. Frontend API URL Configuration

**Validation Performed**: Frontend environment configuration properly points to the standardized backend endpoint:

javascript

`// frontend/src/services/cartService.ts const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000/api';`

**Configuration Confirmed**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api` maintains consistency across all frontend API calls.5.9.-Day-5.5-HIGH-PRIORITY-Port-Mismatch-Between-Frontend-and-Backend.md+1

## Validation Results

## **Backend Health Endpoint Accessibility**

**Test Executed**:

bash

`curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`

**Expected Response**:

json

`{"status": "ok"}`

**Result**: ✅ **PASSED** - Backend health endpoint successfully accessible from host machine, confirming proper port mapping and API prefix configuration.5.8.-Day-5.5-HIGH-PRIORITY-Docker-Network-Configuration-Issues.md

## **Frontend Smoke Test Execution**

**Test Script**: `node frontend/scripts/smoke.mjs`

**Test Coverage**:

- **Catalog API Connectivity**: Validates product listing endpoint accessibility
    
- **Authentication Flow**: Confirms login/registration API integration
    
- **Environment Configuration**: Verifies NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL resolution
    

**Result**: ✅ **PASSED** - Both catalog and authentication checks completed successfully, indicating baseline connectivity is operational.5.7.-Day-5.5.md

## **Service Health Verification**

**Container Status Check**:

bash

`docker-compose ps`

**Services Verified**:

- **postgres**: Healthy (passes pg_isready health check)
    
- **redis**: Healthy (responds to redis-cli ping)
    
- **backend**: Healthy (responds to health endpoint)
    

**Inter-service Communication**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - Backend successfully connects to PostgreSQL and Redis using Docker service names.5.8.-Day-5.5-HIGH-PRIORITY-Docker-Network-Configuration-Issues.md

## Technical Achievements

## **Docker Network Resolution**

The implementation resolves the fundamental Docker networking issues by:

1. **Port Mapping Implementation**: Backend service now properly exposes port 3000 for external access
    
2. **Service Name Resolution**: Database and Redis connections use appropriate Docker service names
    
3. **Health Check Integration**: All services implement proper health checks with dependency management
    
4. **Environment Override Strategy**: Docker-specific configurations override development defaults without breaking local development workflow
    

## **Port Configuration Standardization**

Successfully eliminates the port mismatch between frontend and backend:

1. **Backend Standardization**: NestJS backend consistently listens on port 3000
    
2. **Frontend Alignment**: All frontend API calls target the correct port through environment configuration
    
3. **Documentation Compliance**: Configuration matches the documented API hosting specifications
    

## **API Prefix Consistency**

Establishes consistent API routing:

1. **Global Prefix**: `/api` prefix applied consistently across all backend endpoints
    
2. **Frontend Integration**: Frontend services correctly target prefixed endpoints
    
3. **Health Endpoint**: Accessible at documented `/api/health` path
    

## Environment Parity Metrics
