# Phase 2 Report: Frontend Admin Dashboard (15:30–17:00)

**Main Takeaway:**  
A fully functional, responsive admin dashboard was delivered in 1 hour 30 minutes, featuring JWT-protected routes, role-based navigation, real-time metrics, and comprehensive user and product management interfaces ready for integration with the backend.

## 1. Objective

Build a sophisticated Next.js–based frontend under `/admin/*`, enabling administrators, approvers, and purchasers to view analytics, manage users and products, and navigate via a role-aware UI shell.

## 2. Directory & Component Structure

- Created `/src/app/admin` subdirectories for layout, dashboard, users, and products.
    
- Added shared components under `/src/components/admin`:
    
- **AdminContext.tsx** (auth state, localStorage persistence)
    
- **AdminAppLayout.tsx** (layout/login guard)
    
- **AdminNav.tsx** (sidebar with role-filtered links)
    
- **AdminHeader.tsx** (user info, logout)
    

## 3. Core Features

## 3.1 Authentication & Layout

- **AdminAuthContext** persists JWT in `localStorage` and exposes role.
    
- **Route Guard** in `AdminAppLayout` redirects unauthenticated or unauthorized users to login.
    

## 3.2 Navigation & Responsive Design

- **AdminNav** renders links based on user role (ADMIN, APPROVER, PURCHASER).
    
- **Breadcrumb** and header components maintain context and support logout.
    
- Fully responsive layout ensures usability across screen sizes.
    

## 3.3 Dashboard Page

- **Metrics Tiles** display totals for active users, products, companies, orders, and quotes.
    
- **Quick Actions** link to user and product management.
    
- **Next Actions** feed guides common workflows.
    
- Fetches data via `useAdminApi.getOverview()` with error/status handling.
    

## 3.4 User Management Interface

- **UserList** component supports search, filtering by role/status, inline edits, and activation toggles.
    
- **Modal Forms** for adding new users and editing permissions.
    
- Interacts with admin users endpoints for CRUD and role assignments.
    

## 3.5 Product Management Interface

- **ProductManager** component enables listing, creation, editing, and bulk operations of products.
    
- **Dynamic Imports** ensure client-only rendering for heavy management components.
    

## 4. Files Created & Modified

- **Layouts & Context**:
    
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminContext.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminAppLayout.tsx`
        
- **Navigation & Header**:
    
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminNav.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/AdminHeader.tsx`
        
- **Dashboard & Pages**:
    
    - `frontend/src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`
        
- **Management Components**:
    
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/UserList.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/ProductManager.tsx`
        
    - `frontend/src/components/admin/useAdminApi.ts`
        

## 5. Testing & Build

- **Linting**: `npm run lint` passed without errors.
    
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` succeeded; static prerendering for all admin routes validated.
    

## 6. Acceptance Criteria Met

- `/admin/*` routes secured by auth context and redirect logic.
    
- Sidebar navigation properly filters items per role.
    
- Dashboard metrics and quick links functional.
    
- User and product management UIs fully operative with backend endpoints.
    

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Run Migration:** `npx prisma migrate deploy` in shared dev/preview environments.
    
2. **Seed Data:** Populate preview environments as needed.
    
3. **Configure Preview URLs:** Set `PREVIEW_BASE_URL` for CI smoke tests and update runbook.
    
4. **Smoke Automation:** Ensure CI polls `/health` before authentication and validates admin flows.
