## Timeline (09:00–16:15)

- **09:00–10:30 — Environment Setup:**
    
    - **Goal:** Configure development workstation with required tools.
        
    - **Commands:**
        
        `# Install Homebrew (if macOS/Linux) and Node version manager (nvm) /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" brew install nvm mkdir -p ~/.nvm # Install Node 18 LTS via nvm (as recommended:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}) nvm install --lts nvm use --lts node -v   # verify Node v18+ # Install GitHub CLI and other tools brew install gh docker  gh --version`
        
    - **Files:** None (system-level installs).
        
    - **Acceptance:** `node -v` shows an LTS version ≥18 (per stack recommendation); `gh auth login` succeeds; basic tools (`git`, `gh`, `docker`) are operational.


**Subject: Analysis of Environment Setup Task (09:00–10:30)**

**Overall Status: Successful**

The environment setup was completed successfully, as all specified acceptance criteria were met based on the provided terminal output.

- **Node.js Installation:** **Success.** The `node -v` command returned `v22.18.0`, which satisfies the requirement for an LTS version ≥18.
    
- **GitHub CLI Authentication:** **Success.** The `gh auth login` process completed successfully, confirming that the tool is operational and authenticated.

10:30–12:00 — Git repository initialization (corrected)

- **Goal:** Create `NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom` via SSH. Add base files. Push to `main`.

- **Commands:**
```bash
# 1) Authenticate GitHub CLI using SSH
gh auth login
# choose: GitHub.com → SSH → upload/confirm key → browser login

# 2) Create repo in the org
gh repo create NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom \
  --public --confirm \
  --description "NCS B2B E-Commerce platform (monorepo)"

# 3) Clone via SSH and enter repo
git clone git@github.com:NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom.git
cd ncs-ecom

# 4) Create base files
cat <<'EOF' > README.md
# NCS B2B E-Commerce

NCS Networks B2B e-commerce platform (modular monolith: NestJS + Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis).
EOF

curl -fsSLo LICENSE https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt
printf "node_modules/\n.env\n" > .gitignore

# 5) First commit and push (set upstream)
git add README.md LICENSE .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: initial repo setup with README, LICENSE, .gitignore"
git push -u origin main
```

**Acceptance:**

- Repo exists at `NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom`.
    
- `main` shows `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`.
    
- Remote uses SSH:
    
    ```bash
    git remote -v | grep '^origin.*git@github.com:NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom.git'
    ```
    
- Optional UI check:
    
    ```bash
    gh repo view NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom --web
    ```
    
### Summary of Execution

The primary goal of creating the `ncs-ecom` GitHub repository and populating it with base files was achieved. You successfully authenticated with the GitHub CLI, created the remote repository, cloned it, and committed the initial `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore` files locally.

---

### Problem & Resolution

- **Problem:** The main obstacle was the repeated `Authentication failed` error during the `git push` command. This happened because the repository was cloned using an HTTPS URL (`https://...`), which prompted for a username and password. GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations, causing the push to fail.
    
- **Resolution:** You correctly identified the authentication method mismatch and resolved it by running `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:...`. This command switched the remote URL from HTTPS to SSH, allowing your pre-authenticated SSH key to be used for the push, which then completed successfully.

13:00–14:30 — Branch protection + governance (corrected)

**Goal:** Protect `main`. Add issue templates via PR.

**Commands:**

```bash
# Protect main (PRs required; admins enforced; no force-push)
gh api --method PUT \
  /repos/NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom/branches/main/protection \
  --input - <<'JSON'
{
  "required_status_checks": null,
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "dismiss_stale_reviews": true,
    "required_approving_review_count": 1
  },
  "restrictions": null
}
JSON

# Create governance templates
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

cat > .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md <<'EOF'

EOF

# Commit via PR (main is protected)
git switch -c chore/add-issue-templates
git add .github/
git commit -m "chore: add issue templates for bug and feature"
git push -u origin chore/add-issue-templates

# Open, approve, and merge PR
gh pr create --title "chore: add issue templates" --body "Adds standard templates for bug reports and feature requests."
gh pr review --approve
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch
```

**Files created:**  
`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`

**Acceptance:**

- Settings → Branches shows protection on `main` with ≥1 review and no force pushes.
    
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` exists on `main`.
    
- `gh api /repos/NCS-Networks-Communication-Solution/ncs-ecom/branches/main/protection` returns the policy.

### Summary of Execution

- **Branch Protection:** You successfully applied the protection rules to the `main` branch.
    
- **Governance Files:** After an initial error creating the pull request from the wrong branch, you correctly switched to the `chore/add-issue-templates` branch, created the pull request, and successfully merged it.
    
- **Outcome:** Both acceptance criteria were met. The `main` branch is protected, and the issue template files are now present in the repository. The redundant commands at the end of the log were harmless and can be disregarded as the task was already complete.

14:30–16:15 — Labels, org Project, and sample issues (corrected)

**Goal:** Define labels. Create and link org Project. Add 10 REQ issues to the Project.

**Commands:**

```bash
# 0) Ensure scopes for Projects
gh auth refresh -s project,read:project   # adds required scopes
```

```bash
# 1) Labels (idempotent)
gh label create "bug"           -c d73a4a -d "Bug: something isn't working" --force
gh label create "enhancement"   -c a2eeef -d "Feature: new capability or improvement" --force
gh label create "documentation" -c 0075ca -d "Docs: documentation changes" --force
gh label create "discussion"    -c 5319e7 -d "Needs discussion" --force
gh label create "feature"       -c 0e8a16 -d "Product feature" --force
```

```bash
# 2) Org Project (Projects, not Classic). Create or reuse, then link repo

PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gh project list --owner "$ORG" --format json --jq ".[] | select(.title==\"$PROJ\") | .number")"
[ -z "$PROJECT_NUMBER" ] && PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gh project create --owner "$ORG" --title "$PROJ" --format json --jq '.number')"
gh project link "$PROJECT_NUMBER" --owner "$ORG" --repo "$REPO"
```

```bash
# 3) Add a custom field to mimic columns

```

**Notes:**

- `--project` on `gh issue create` adds issues to the named Project. Requires `project` scope. ([GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_issue_create "GitHub CLI | Take GitHub to the command line"))
    
- Use `gh project create`, `link`, `field-create`, and `item-list` for Projects (not Classic). ([GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_project_list?utm_source=chatgpt.com "gh project list"))
    
- Label creation flags and hex color format per CLI manual. ([GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_label_create?utm_source=chatgpt.com "gh label create"))

## Final Report

- **Labels:** All five required issue labels were created.
    
- **Project Board:** The "NCS B2B Board" was successfully created and linked to the repository.
    
- **Issues:** All ten requirement issues were created and, after troubleshooting, were **successfully linked** to the project board.
    

The key to success was the final script, which programmatically found the correct URLs for each issue instead of guessing the numbers. The successful completion of that script, with no errors, confirms that the task is now 100% complete.
