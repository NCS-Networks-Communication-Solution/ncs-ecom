## 9. Deviations from Plan

### Positive Deviations:
1. **Node.js Version:** Using v22.18.0 instead of v18.x LTS

   - **Decision:** Continue with v22

2. **Project Board Enhancement:** Added "Backlog" column
   - **Rationale:** Better workflow management
   - **Impact:** Improved task organization

### Resolved Issues:
1. **GraphQL API Syntax:** Initial attempts to update project fields failed due to incorrect mutation structure
   - **Resolution:** Corrected API call syntax after research
   - **Time Impact:** ~30 minutes additional

## 10. Next Steps (Day 2 - September 19, 2025)

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. ✅ Review and merge the `fix/day1-governance-alignment` branch to main
2. Begin Proxmox cluster setup (half day available)
3. Provision PostgreSQL VM with specifications:
   - 4 GB RAM
   - 2 vCPU  
   - 50 GB disk
   - VLAN 10 configuration

### Preparation Checklist for Day 2:
- [ ] Confirm Proxmox cluster access credentials
- [ ] Verify network configuration (10.0.10.x subnet)
- [ ] Prepare Ubuntu Server ISO for VM installation
- [ ] Review PostgreSQL PITR configuration requirements

---

## 11. Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks:
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Proxmox access delays | Low | High | Request credentials today |
| Network configuration issues | Medium | Medium | Document current network topology |
| Time constraint (half day) | High | Low | Prioritize critical VM setup |

---

## 12. Recommendations

1. **Documentation:** Create a `docs/` directory in the repository for:
   - Infrastructure setup guides
   - API documentation templates
   - Development environment setup

2. **CI/CD Preparation:** Consider creating `.github/workflows/` directory structure today for tomorrow's CI/CD pipeline setup

3. **Secrets Management:** Prepare `.env.example` file with placeholder values for configuration

4. **Team Communication:** Share this report with stakeholders to confirm Day 1 completion

---
