do the Execution Plan's Phase 1[only that only please in case there are lot of problem, so we can go through one problem at a time]{
Execution Plan

Anchor on the Day 5 scope shift that depriorizes any redo of catalog/auth work and pushes us toward admin console + cart deliverables once platform prerequisites are covered (context/6.1. Day-5-Revised-Execution-Plan.md:13). This plan addresses the three outstanding enablement items called out after Session #3 before we dive back into those feature streams.

Phase 1: CI Docker Artifact Publishing

Confirm the Docker build currently produced in CI (docker build --target production -t ncs-backend-ci .) and identify the registry target (GitHub Container Registry or an internal registry). Add workflow steps after the existing build in .github/workflows/ci.yml to authenticate (docker/login-action@v3 with GHCR_PAT secret) and push the image using the run number or commit SHA as the tag; capture the digest in the job summary for traceability (context/5.8. Day 4.5 Debugging 3.md:160).
Gate publishing behind main-branch pushes to avoid test images flooding the registry; for PRs, keep the build but skip the push with an IF condition. Ensure secrets are defined in the repo before merging the workflow change.
Validation: rerun the workflow on a branch, verify that the artifact publishes successfully, and document the image coordinates plus pull instructions in docs/evidence/week-1/docker-status.md alongside the existing compose notes.
Phase 2: Smoke Test Automation Readiness

Because the smoke script already validates /products and /auth/login (context/5.8. Day 4.5 Debugging 3.md:81), introduce a neutral CI job that prepares to call it once a preview backend exists. Create a job with a placeholder “wait-for-preview” step that currently exits early but documents the TODO, so future work only needs to flip a flag.
Define the expected preview environment contract (base URL, auth headers, timeout) in docs/plans/week-2-follow-up.md to keep the dependency explicit. Once infra provides the URL, replace the placeholder with a curl health check plus npm run smoke invocation, propagate failures to the aggregate status check, and archive the log output as an artifact for triage.
Phase 3: Week 1 Report Enhancements

Extend docs/reports/Week-1-Execution-Report.md with a new “Frontend Evidence” subsection that summarizes the catalog/auth outcome from Session #3 and links to the smoke instructions already captured (context/5.8. Day 4.5 Debugging 3.md:86). Add references to the catalog/auth screenshots you will place under docs/evidence/week-1/ (PNG files named catalog.png, auth.png) and describe what each image demonstrates.
Keep the historical narrative intact; append an addendum noting that Week 1 goals were surpassed with the full catalog UI, cross-referencing the revised Day 5 plan to show the shift toward admin/cart workstreams (context/6.1. Day-5-Revised-Execution-Plan.md:15).
Sequencing & Next Actions

Tackle the CI workflow change first so every subsequent branch benefits from published images.
Stage the smoke-job scaffold next to prevent broken automation when the preview service appears.
Update the Week 1 report once screenshots are captured; commit the media files alongside the markdown edit.
With these enablers closed, resume the Day 5 feature build focusing on admin console and cart implementations without touching the delivered catalog surface.
