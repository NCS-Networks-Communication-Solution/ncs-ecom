# Day 1 Execution Guide – NCS B2B E-Commerce

This guide walks through Day 1 tasks (09:00–16:15) for initializing the NCS B2B e-commerce project. We follow the Month 1 plan, which emphasizes **project initialization and base system setup**. Each timeline block includes a _Goal_, terminal-ready _Commands_, _Files_ created/edited, and _Acceptance_ criteria.

## Timeline (09:00–16:15)

- **09:00–10:30 — Environment Setup:**
    
    - **Goal:** Configure development workstation with required tools.
        
    - **Commands:**
        
        `# Install Homebrew (if macOS/Linux) and Node version manager (nvm) /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" brew install nvm mkdir -p ~/.nvm # Install Node 18 LTS via nvm (as recommended:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}) nvm install --lts nvm use --lts node -v   # verify Node v18+ # Install GitHub CLI and other tools brew install gh docker  gh --version`
        
    - **Files:** None (system-level installs).
        
    - **Acceptance:** `node -v` shows an LTS version ≥18 (per stack recommendation); `gh auth login` succeeds; basic tools (`git`, `gh`, `docker`) are operational.


**Subject: Analysis of Environment Setup Task (09:00–10:30)**

**Overall Status: Successful**

The environment setup was completed successfully, as all specified acceptance criteria were met based on the provided terminal output.

- **Node.js Installation:** **Success.** The `node -v` command returned `v22.18.0`, which satisfies the requirement for an LTS version ≥18.
    
- **GitHub CLI Authentication:** **Success.** The `gh auth login` process completed successfully, confirming that the tool is operational and authenticated.


- **10:30–12:00 — Git Repository Initialization:**
    
    - **Goal:** Create the GitHub repo `ncs-ecom` and populate it with base files.
        
    - **Commands:**
        
        `gh auth login  # ensure authenticated with GitHub gh repo create NCSNetworks/ncs-ecom --public --confirm --description "NCS B2B E-Commerce platform (monorepo)" git clone https://github.com/NCSNetworks/ncs-ecom.git cd ncs-ecom # Create initial project files cat <<EOF > README.md # NCS B2B E-Commerce  NCS Networks B2B e-commerce platform (modular monolith: NestJS + Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}. EOF curl -o LICENSE https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt echo -e "node_modules/\n.env" > .gitignore`
        
    - **Files:** `README.md`, `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0), `.gitignore` (ignores `node_modules`, `.env`), and placeholder governance files (`.github/`) created.
        
    - **Acceptance:** Repository `ncs-ecom` is visible on GitHub with these files on the `main` branch. A first commit should be made, e.g.,
        
        `git add README.md LICENSE .gitignore git commit -m "chore: initial repo setup with README, LICENSE, .gitignore" git push origin main`
        
        Verify via GitHub UI or `gh repo view ncs-ecom` that files exist.

The task from 10:30–12:00 was ultimately a **success**, though it was delayed by a recurring authentication issue that required troubleshooting.

### Summary of Execution

The primary goal of creating the `ncs-ecom` GitHub repository and populating it with base files was achieved. You successfully authenticated with the GitHub CLI, created the remote repository, cloned it, and committed the initial `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore` files locally.

---

### Problem & Resolution

- **Problem:** The main obstacle was the repeated `Authentication failed` error during the `git push` command. This happened because the repository was cloned using an HTTPS URL (`https://...`), which prompted for a username and password. GitHub no longer supports password authentication for Git operations, causing the push to fail.
    
- **Resolution:** You correctly identified the authentication method mismatch and resolved it by running `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:...`. This command switched the remote URL from HTTPS to SSH, allowing your pre-authenticated SSH key to be used for the push, which then completed successfully.

- **13:00–14:30 — Branch Protection & Governance Files:**
    
    - **Goal:** Enforce branch policies and add governance templates.
        
    - **Commands:**
        
        `# Protect main branch (require PR reviews, disallow force pushes) gh api --method PUT /repos/NCSNetworks/ncs-ecom/branches/main/protection \   -f required_pull_request_reviews.dismiss_stale_reviews=true \   -f required_pull_request_reviews.required_approving_review_count=1 \   -f enforce_admins=true \   -f restrictions=""  # Create issue and PR templates mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE cat <<EOF > .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md --- name: Bug report about: Report a problem or unexpected behavior title: "[BUG] REQ-XYZ-??: " labels: bug --- **Describe the bug**   A clear and concise description of what the bug is.  **To Reproduce**   Steps to reproduce the behavior.  **Expected behavior**   A clear description of what you expected to happen.  **Environment (please complete the following information):** - OS: - Browser:  **Additional context**   Add any other context about the problem here. EOF  cat <<EOF > .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md --- name: Feature request about: Suggest a new feature or enhancement title: "[FEAT] REQ-XYZ-??: " labels: enhancement --- **Describe the solution you'd like**   A clear description of what you want to happen.  **Acceptance Criteria**   - Criterion 1 - Criterion 2  **Additional context**   Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. EOF  # Add files and commit git add .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE git commit -m "chore: add issue templates for bug and feature" git push`
        
    - **Files:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`.
        
    - **Acceptance:** In the GitHub repo UI, the `Settings → Branches` page shows protection on `main` (no force pushes, require ≥1 reviewer). The `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` directory appears with both templates.
### Summary of Execution

- **Branch Protection:** You successfully applied the protection rules to the `main` branch.
    
- **Governance Files:** After an initial error creating the pull request from the wrong branch, you correctly switched to the `chore/add-issue-templates` branch, created the pull request, and successfully merged it.
    
- **Outcome:** Both acceptance criteria were met. The `main` branch is protected, and the issue template files are now present in the repository. The redundant commands at the end of the log were harmless and can be disregarded as the task was already complete.

- **14:30–16:15 — Label Set, Project Board & Sample Issues:**
    
    - **Goal:** Define issue labels, set up project board, and stub initial issues from core requirements.
        
    - **Commands:**
        
        `# Create standard labels gh label create "bug" -c d73a4a -d "Bug: something isn't working" gh label create "enhancement" -c a2eeef -d "Feature: new capability or improvement" gh label create "documentation" -c 0075ca -d "Docs: documentation changes" gh label create "discussion" -c 5319e7 -d "Needs discussion"  # Create a project board with specified columns gh project create "NCS B2B Board" --body "Day-1 task board" --board --repo NCSNetworks/ncs-ecom gh project column create --project "NCS B2B Board" "Backlog" gh project column create --project "NCS B2B Board" "Ready" gh project column create --project "NCS B2B Board" "In Progress" gh project column create --project "NCS B2B Board" "In Review" gh project column create --project "NCS B2B Board" "Done"  # Stub sample issues with Requirement IDs (from design docs) and AC gh issue create --title "REQ-RFQ-001: Customer RFQ submission (cart → quote request)" \   --body "- **Given** a user submits an RFQ via their shopping cart\n- **When** the RFQ is submitted,\n- **Then** the user’s portal shows the RFQ with status \"Pending NCS Response\" and a confirmation email is sent:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}." \   --label "enhancement"  gh issue create --title "REQ-RFQ-002: Admin quote management interface" \   --body "- **Given** sales staff view an RFQ,\n- **When** the staff edits and marks a quote as \"Quoted\",\n- **Then** the customer’s portal shows the updated quote and the customer is notified:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}." \   --label "enhancement"  gh issue create --title "REQ-RFQ-003: Quote-to-order conversion (one-click)" \   --body "- **Given** a customer accepts a quote,\n- **When** they click **Convert to Order**,\n- **Then** the quote items and prices transfer to a new order and checkout proceeds without re-entering details:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}." \   --label "enhancement"  gh issue create --title "REQ-PAY-001: PromptPay QR code generation (real-time)" \   --body "- **Given** a user selects PromptPay at checkout,\n- **When** the order is finalized,\n- **Then** the confirmation page displays a scannable QR code for payment and the order status is set to \"Pending Payment\":contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}." \   --label "feature"  gh issue create --title "REQ-PAY-002: Bank transfer payment with proof upload" \   --body "- **Given** a user selects Bank Transfer,\n- **When** the order is placed,\n- **Then** the system provides bank transfer instructions and allows the user to upload payment proof afterward:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}." \   --label "feature"  gh issue create --title "REQ-CAT-001: Hierarchical category navigation" \   --body "- **Given** a category hierarchy is defined,\n- **When** a user browses categories,\n- **Then** they can drill down through multiple levels (e.g., Networking → Switches → Managed) to find products:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}." \   --label "feature"  gh issue create --title "REQ-CART-001: Persistent shopping cart across sessions" \   --body "- **Given** a logged-in user with items in their cart,\n- **When** they log out and later log in again,\n- **Then** their cart contents remain intact and accessible:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}." \   --label "feature"  gh issue create --title "REQ-ACC-001: Multi-user account with role-based permissions" \   --body "- **Given** a business account with multiple users,\n- **When** an approver is required for high-value orders,\n- **Then** only users with the approver role can finalize orders exceeding the spending limit:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}." \   --label "feature"  gh issue create --title "REQ-PAY-003: Automated Thai tax invoice generation" \   --body "- **Given** an order is completed,\n- **When** payment is confirmed,\n- **Then** the system generates a PDF invoice in Thai tax format (showing VAT breakdown) for download:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}." \   --label "feature"  gh issue create --title "REQ-PTY-001: Partner registration and portal setup" \   --body "- **Given** a partner company registers on the platform,\n- **When** they submit required credentials,\n- **Then** the account is created under a partner role (e.g., Bronze/Silver tier) after verification:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}." \   --label "feature"`
        
    - **Acceptance:** In GitHub: labels “bug”, “enhancement”, “documentation”, etc., are present. The “NCS B2B Board” project exists with columns Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done. Ten issues (at least) are created in the Backlog with titles matching the REQ IDs and AC bullet lists referencing the design docs (e.g. etc.). Verify by viewing issue list and project board.
        
## ## Final Report

- **Labels:** All five required issue labels were created.
    
- **Project Board:** The "NCS B2B Board" was successfully created and linked to the repository.
    
- **Issues:** All ten requirement issues were created and, after troubleshooting, were **successfully linked** to the project board.
    

The key to success was the final script, which programmatically found the correct URLs for each issue instead of guessing the numbers. The successful completion of that script, with no errors, confirms that the task is now 100% complete.
## Git Artifacts

- **Repo Structure:** Ensure `ncs-ecom` has at least `README.md`, `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0 or MIT), `.gitignore`, and a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` if needed. Each file should have meaningful content (e.g. README outlines project purpose).
    
- **Initial Commit:** Use a clear commit message, e.g. `chore: initial project setup (README, LICENSE, .gitignore)`. The commit history should start with this snapshot.
    
- **Branch Protection:** Protect the `main` branch via GitHub settings or CLI: require pull requests with ≥1 review, disallow force pushes, optionally require status checks (e.g. CI).
    
- **Governance Files:** Under `.github/`, the issue and PR templates are present. Optionally include `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a `SECURITY.md`.
    
- **Example Git Commands:**
    
    `gh repo create NCSNetworks/ncs-ecom --public --confirm git clone git@github.com:NCSNetworks/ncs-ecom.git cd ncs-ecom touch README.md LICENSE .gitignore git add . git commit -m "chore: initial repo setup with base files" git push -u origin main`
    

## Governance Setup

- **Issue Templates:** Two templates (`bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`) in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` guide contributors on writing issues. They auto-populate the “Issue” form on GitHub.
    
- **Labels:** Create a common label set, e.g.: `bug`, `enhancement` (or `feature`), `documentation`, `discussion`, etc. Color-code them for clarity. For example, red for bugs (`#d73a4a`), blue for enhancements (`#a2eeef`), green for docs (`#0075ca`).
    
- **Project Board:** Use GitHub Projects (v2) or Classic Projects to create a board “NCS B2B Board” with columns **Backlog**, **Ready**, **In Progress**, **In Review**, **Done**. Associate issues by moving them into columns or linking via PRs.
    
- **Stubbed Issues:** We created at least 10 issues tied to core requirements from the Tech Design Doc, each with a REQ ID in the title and acceptance criteria citing the design docs. For example, **REQ-RFQ-001** for RFQ submission and **REQ-PAY-001** for PromptPay QR. These issues should be in the Backlog column.
    

## Workstation Preparation

- **Homebrew & nvm:** Already installed above.
    
- **Node.js (v18 LTS):** Ensure the LTS version is active (`node -v` shows ≥18.x). This aligns with the recommended stack (NestJS on Node).
    
- **CLI Tools:** Install GitHub CLI (`gh`), Docker (for containerization), and any other needed tools (e.g. `psql` client if you plan local Postgres).
    
- **VS Code Extensions:** Recommended extensions: ESLint, Prettier, Docker, GitLens, Path Intellisense, and a REST client (e.g. Thunder Client).
    
- **VS Code Settings:** Example `settings.json` snippet to enforce code quality:
    
    `{   "editor.formatOnSave": true,   "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {     "source.fixAll.eslint": true   },   "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",   "files.autoSaveDelay": 1000,   "editor.fontSize": 14 }`
    
- **Environment Variables:** Set up `.env.local` or similar with placeholders (do **not** commit secrets). Ensure your shell RC (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) loads `nvm`.
    

## Evidence Pack

Collect the following for the report (screenshots or command outputs):

- **Configuration Verification:** Run and capture outputs of `node -v`, `npm -v`, `gh auth status`, and `docker version`. Save as evidence that Node 18+, GH CLI, Docker are installed.
    
- **Repository Checklist:** Screenshot the GitHub repo home showing `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, and the protected branch settings.
    
- **Governance Artifacts:** Capture (a) the Issue Templates list under “Settings → Issues”, (b) the Labels list, (c) the Projects board overview with columns, and (d) one of the stub issue pages (showing title, AC, and the cited reference context).
    
- **Branch Protection:** Screenshot the “Branches” settings page showing protection rules for `main`.
    
- **Project Board:** Screenshot or list showing columns Backlog/Ready/In Progress/In Review/Done populated (or empty ready for use).
    
- **Issue Samples:** Screenshot at least one issue detail (with title and AC) that includes a cited reference, and show its assignment to the project board.
    

## Day 1 Risks and Done Criteria

- **Risks:** Potential Day-1 risks include: delays in receiving necessary permissions (GitHub org access), network/install issues blocking tool setup, or configuration mismatches (e.g. wrong Node version). Mitigate by having rollback plans (e.g. use a pre-existing dev machine or container) and verifying each install. Also watch for any unexpected company policies (e.g. proxy settings) that could impede setup.
    
- **Done Means:** At end of Day 1, the following should be **complete**: development workstation is ready (brew/nvm/Node/CLI tools installed and verified); `ncs-ecom` repo exists with initial files (`README`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`); branch protection is enabled on `main`; issue templates and labels are in place; the project board is created with correct columns; and at least 10 requirement-based issues are stubbed with titles, acceptance criteria, and source citations. All acceptance checks above should be satisfied without gaps.
    

**Sources:** We follow the project’s tech/design documentation. For example, the **month 1 plan** calls for initial setup work. The **tech stack** mandates Node/Nest/Next with Postgres and Redis, so we install Node 18 LTS. The **requirements docs** provide REQ IDs and AC that we use when stubbing issues (e.g. RFQ and payment workflows). All instructions are aligned with those source guidelines.
