## Position Relative to Month 1 Timeline

**Behind Schedule Items**
- Auth Module Implementation: JWT authentication endpoints pending
- Product Catalog API: Database integration for product queries pending  
- RFQ Workflow: Quote generation and order conversion logic pending

**Ahead of Schedule Items**
- CI/CD Pipeline: Originally planned for Day 5, completed Day 2
- Environment Templates: Comprehensive configuration management established
- API Documentation: OpenAPI specification complete with validation

**Timeline Impact Assessment**
- Days Behind: 1-2 days due to Prisma blocker and recovery effort
- Recovery Feasibility: High confidence in catching up during Week 2
- Launch Date Impact: January 11, 2026 target remains achievable
- Risk Mitigation: Parallel development approach validated as effective

## Week 2 Readiness Assessment

**Immediate Next Steps (Days 4-5)**
1. Complete Auth Module: Implement JWT authentication, user registration, login endpoints
2. Product Catalog Integration: Connect Prisma models to REST API endpoints
3. Database Seeding: Create sample products, companies, and user accounts
4. Integration Testing: Verify full stack data flow from frontend to database

**Final Week 1 Status: SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS WITH SOLID FOUNDATION**

Despite encountering and resolving a significant technical blocker, Week 1 delivered a robust, scalable foundation for the NCS B2B E-Commerce platform. The combination of successfully deployed infrastructure, working CI/CD pipeline, functional frontend application, and resolved backend architecture positions the project strongly for accelerated business logic development in Week 2.

**The January 11, 2026 launch timeline remains viable** with disciplined execution of the established development processes and the architectural resilience demonstrated this week.
